- 👋 Hi, I’m @annh9876
- 👀 I’m interested in immudb for standardized evaluation intangible products and the products of freedom, fair, and honest and faithful
exchange (auction market); the data of creating inangible products were not changed and record every single part work histry (version 
controls in all the way)for the future copyrights, patent, brands, trade mark & more valuble intangible products exchange and more...
Actually the types intangible products could be music, literary, software, app, arts and more...
The sources of intangible products,  they are never being exhausted; the customers could be all smartphone holders, , they don't have ages,
races, locations to be limited; and the custemers could be intangible producers---I am a dreamer, is the type platform or website already existed?
If the million developers build the type of platform for themselves, their works were record permanent, evaluated, auction exchanged, all the
intangible products creators could get their values exposure to public, less Van Gogh's fates; the smartphone brought the world together; 
immudb would bring freedom, fair, faithful and integrate power; the the evaluation intangible products platform would give opportunities all
intangible products into tangible and all smartphone holders could enjoy the creating new world benefits and the world encourage advanced, 
opening, creating cultures, again, is the type of platform existing? 
Could immudb work on the type website or platform? I would appreciate the responses.

electronic devices.
